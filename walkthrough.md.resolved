## ✅ All Features Implemented

Every item from the original plan is complete and deployed. Here's how to test each feature end-to-end:

---

## Test 1: Full Booking Flow (Customer)

> This tests: date persistence, deposit receipt upload, credit application, printable receipt

1. **Open** `bubatbook.vercel.app` (logged out)
2. **Pick dates** → click a car → click **"Book Now"**
3. You'll be redirected to **Login** with dates preserved
4. **Login** → you'll land on **Checkout** with dates pre-filled ✨
5. On Checkout:
   - See deposit breakdown (min RM100 or 30%)
   - If you have credit, it's auto-applied
   - **Upload a receipt image** (any image for testing)
   - Click **"Confirm & Pay Deposit"**
6. You'll see the **Booking Confirmation** page
7. Click **"Print Receipt"** → a new tab opens with a styled receipt + 🖨️ Print button

---

## Test 2: Full Payment Upload (Customer)

1. Go to **My Bookings** (once admin confirms your booking to CONFIRMED)
2. You'll see a purple box: *"Upload your full rental payment receipt"*
3. Upload an image → click **Upload**
4. Status shows *"Full payment receipt submitted — awaiting verification"*

---

## Test 3: Admin Booking Management

> This tests: status progression, date editing, receipt verification, credit return

1. Login as admin → **Admin Dashboard** → **Bookings** → click a booking
2. **Status buttons** at top right: each button progresses the booking:
   - `HOLD → DEPOSIT_PAID → CONFIRMED → PICKUP → RETURNED`
   - Cancel button available for HOLD/DEPOSIT_PAID/CONFIRMED
3. **Edit Dates**: click "Edit Dates" → change dates → Save
4. **Deposit Receipt**: if uploaded, click ✓ Verify or ✗ Reject
5. **Full Payment**: if uploaded, click ✓ Verify
6. **Mark Returned**: sets `actual_return_date` and **auto-returns deposit as credit** to the customer's profile

---

## Test 4: Deposit Credit System

1. After a booking is marked **RETURNED** (Test 3, step 6), the deposit amount is added to the customer's credit
2. Go to **Profile** → you'll see your credit balance
3. **Book again** → on Checkout, credit is auto-deducted from the deposit amount
4. As admin: go to **Customers** → expand a customer → see credit balance → enter an amount + reason → click **"Deduct Credit"**

---

## Test 5: Verification System

1. Login as a new/unverified user → navbar shows yellow **"Verify"** link
2. Go to `/verify` → fill IC number, licence expiry, phone, address (with Malaysian state dropdown), upload IC + licence images
3. As admin: go to **Customers** → expand the user → click **"Verify Customer"**
4. User is now verified. If they update docs later, old verification stays valid until admin approves new docs
5. **Expired licence**: if licence expiry passes, user auto-loses verified status

---
