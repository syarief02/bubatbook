## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Supabase project with Auth, Storage, and PostgreSQL enabled

### Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/syarief02/bubatbook.git
cd bubatbook

# Install
npm install

# Environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase keys
```

### Environment Variables

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Database Migration

```bash
# Run the full migration (requires DATABASE_URL in .env.local)
node run_migration.cjs
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build      # Production build
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

### ✅ Android Upload Smoke Test Checklist

Due to historical issues with Android Chrome and `supabase-js`, we use a custom `XMLHttpRequest` wrapper to read files into memory (`ArrayBuffer`) and bypass the buggy streaming API.
When testing on Android devices, verify the following:

1. **Size Limit:** Attempt to upload an image >10MB. Ensure a clear error toast appears.
2. **Format Limit:** Attempt to upload a `.heic` or `.heif` image. Ensure the "format not supported" error toast appears.
3. **Progress Tracking:** Upload a valid image (e.g., 2MB JPEG). Ensure the toast shows "Step 1", "Step 2", and "Uploading: 50%...".
4. **Success State:** Once upload completes, ensure the form submits successfully without hanging on "Saving..." indefinitely.
5. **Flows to Check:** Test "Add Credit Receipt" (`Customers.jsx`), "Deposit Receipt" (`Checkout.jsx`), and "Customer Verification" (`VerifyAccount.jsx`).

## 💰 Payment Flow

```
1. Customer selects dates + car
2. Deposit calculated (max of RM100 or 30% of total)
3. Available credit auto-deducted from deposit
4. Customer uploads deposit receipt image
5. Admin verifies deposit receipt
6. At pickup: customer uploads full rental payment receipt
7. Admin verifies full payment
8. On return: deposit auto-returned as credit to customer profile
```

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant & Group Management

Rent2Go uses a multi-tenant architecture where different businesses (Fleet Groups) can manage their own cars and bookings on the platform.

### Switching Group Context

If you are a **Super Admin** or belong to multiple groups, you can switch your active group using the **dropdown selector in the top-right Admin Navbar**.

- Every action you take (adding cars, viewing bookings, adding members) is automatically tied to the group currently selected in this dropdown.

### How to Assign an Admin to a Group

1. Switch to the target group in the top-right Navbar dropdown.
2. Go to **Admin -> Members**.
3. Search for the customer's email or phone number.
4. Select the user, choose the "Fleet Admin" role, and click Add.

### How to Ensure Added Vehicles Belong to a Group

1. Switch to the target group in the top-right Navbar dropdown.
2. Go to **Admin -> Fleet -> Add New Car**.
3. Fill in the car details and save. The car is **automatically assigned** to the group you selected in Step 1.
